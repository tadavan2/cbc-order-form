        <h3>1.1 Why These Units?</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Meristem Tubes & Acclimated Pots (2-Unit Minimum):</strong> These represent the apex of our clean stock pyramid. Each unit has been through meristem excision, tissue culture, and comprehensive pathogen screening. The 2-unit minimum reflects the operational reality of establishing mother plants for tissue culture multiplication—setting up infrastructure, hanging mother plants, and maintaining sterile conditions for a single unit is not economically viable. The per-unit pricing reflects the laboratory-intensive process, sterile facility requirements, and extensive testing protocols.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Certified Bin Stock (50-Runner Minimum):</strong> The propagation chain works as follows: one acclimated meristem pot is planted to establish one bin (mother plant block), which typically harvests 100-300 runners depending on growing conditions and variety. We sell runners in 50-unit increments because this represents practical logistics for harvest, grading, cold storage, and shipping. The 50-runner minimum also aligns with industry-standard planting densities and allows customers to calculate field requirements efficiently while ensuring we're not processing small, uneconomical orders.</p>
        
        <p><strong>White Tag Foundation Stock (Half Plot = 50 Plants, Full Plot = 100 Plants):</strong> Foundation plots are established field plantings that serve as mother stock for commercial nursery operations. By regulation, a full plot cannot exceed 100 mother plants. A half plot requires 50 plants for establishment. To put this in perspective: a single bin harvest of 300 runners provides sufficient material to establish three full 100-plant plots for white tag production. Pricing reflects land preparation, establishment costs, ongoing maintenance, certification fees, and the productive value of established mother stock.</p>
        
        <h2>2. PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS & QUALITY STANDARDS</h2>
        
        <p>All CBC plant material is produced under California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) certification programs and undergoes rigorous pathogen screening.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>⚠️ LIVING PLANT MATERIAL DISCLAIMER</strong>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Strawberry plants are living biological organisms subject to numerous environmental, cultural, and pathogenic factors beyond the control of the seller. While CBC maintains the highest standards of production and certification, plant performance is affected by factors including but not limited to: climate conditions, soil characteristics, water quality, grower practices, pest and disease pressure, handling during transport, storage conditions, and planting techniques.</p>

        <h2>6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY & PLANT PATENTS</h2>
        
        <p>CBC cultivars are protected by U.S. Plant Patents and/or Plant Variety Protection certificates. Purchase of plant material DOES NOT grant rights to propagate, sell, or distribute plants or plant parts without explicit written authorization from California Berry Cultivars, LLC or its authorized master licensee, Eurosemillas, S.A. Unauthorized propagation is a violation of federal law and subjects violators to legal action.</p>
        
        <p>Customers purchasing foundation stock or nursery propagation rights operate under separate licensing agreements that specify authorized propagation and distribution rights. For licensing inquiries in international markets, contact Eurosemillas, S.A. (master licensee) or California Berry Cultivars, LLC directly.</p>
        
        <h2>7. FORCE MAJEURE</h2>

        <p>In the event of production shortfalls, CBC reserves the right to allocate available material among customers on a pro-rata basis or in accordance with deposit payment dates.</p>
        
        <h2>8. INTERNATIONAL SHIPMENTS</h2>

            <li>Complying with all phytosanitary and customs requirements of the destination country</li>

            <li>All customs duties, taxes, and clearance fees</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>CBC will provide reasonable assistance with documentation but cannot guarantee approval of import permits or successful customs clearance. Delays or rejections by regulatory authorities are not grounds for refund once material has been prepared for shipment.</p>
        
        <h2>9. CANCELLATIONS & MODIFICATIONS</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Cancellation Policy:</strong> Orders cancelled more than 90 days prior to scheduled delivery are subject to a 25% restocking fee.
